  <h3>11th Annual Merrimack Valley Film Festival</h3>
  <p>Throughout the week a number of people who were members of the Boston Church of Christ cult came forward to receive Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior.&nbsp; All were referred to Evangelical / Bible believing churches for follow-up.</p>
  <p>Three sisters ages 12, 14, &amp; 15 who moved to So. Lawrence a few months ago from Philadelphia were eating at Taco Bell on Rt. 114.&nbsp; A woman was walking around giving out free tickets to the Christian Film Festival.&nbsp; She gave tickets to the 3 girls.&nbsp; They came to the film festival and when the invitation was given all three responded together.&nbsp; They came forward and received Jesus as their Lord and Savior.&nbsp; They had no church affiliation and never clearly understood who Jesus was until today!&nbsp; They came back the next day and went forward for special prayer.&nbsp; The day before they didn&rsquo;t really know what prayer was.</p>
  <p>A 43-year-old man did not know how to accept the Lord or how to be saved.&nbsp; I led him through the &ldquo;My Commitment&rdquo; folder, answering his questions and he happily received Jesus into his heart.&nbsp; His whole family was so happy and excited that they were all saved now.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A sweet 8-year-old girl came forward to trust in Jesus as her Lord and Savior.&nbsp; They just happened to stop in the theater to purchase something and saw the free movies &ndash; they decided to stay.&nbsp; Thank you Lord!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; a 26-year-old young man has been attending a church and working with a youth group but never committed his life to the Lord.&nbsp; David came forward today and gave his life to Jesus.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Samantha, a 13-year-old foster child, lived with foster parents who didn&rsquo;t take her to church.&nbsp; She is now staying with Christian foster parents.&nbsp; She at one time attended a Catholic church.&nbsp; She said it wasn&rsquo;t the same message like she heard at the festival, so she wanted to make sure she truly received Jesus the way God says.&nbsp; Now she wants to live for Jesus. </p>
  <p>Maria is a 49 year-old woman.&nbsp; When Tom was giving the invitation she was afraid to go forward but suddenly she felt an urge to walk up front.&nbsp; She confessed she now understood that there really was a hell.&nbsp; She received Christ as her personal Lord and Savior.&nbsp; She was very sad because her 21 year-old son was killed in a car accident recently.&nbsp; She wants to receive follow-up and she left the theater contented that she was truly going to heaven.&nbsp; Praise God!<br>
      <br>
    On Wednesday after &ldquo;Escape from Hell&rdquo;, many teenagers from two youth groups went forward.&nbsp; I counseled two Cambodian girls, Christine, 15, and Channy, 20.&nbsp; Christine was so overjoyed about receiving Jesus that she could not stop crying.&nbsp; Channy also received Jesus.&nbsp; Thank you God for the outpouring of your Holy Spirit on so many teenagers and young adults.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time Changer&rdquo; was over.&nbsp; As the theater emptied I noticed a woman at the back of the theater.&nbsp; I went up to talk to her.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t sure that if she died she would go to heaven.&nbsp; Her husband had been down to give a donation and had returned to sit with his wife.&nbsp; I asked him if he knew for sure that he would go to heaven if he died.&nbsp; He said he wasn&rsquo;t sure.&nbsp; I went through the salvation plan with them as they both received Jesus as Savior.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Tribulation Force brought many to the front of the theater.&nbsp; I counseled a little boy 10 years old.&nbsp; He prayed to receive Jesus as Savior.&nbsp; Praise God for saving this little boy.<br>
      <br>
    A 12-year-old boy named Eric came to the Christian Film Festival with his youth group from Natick, MA.&nbsp; He received Jesus as his personal Lord and Savior.&nbsp; Other boys from the group (who were invited guests) also came forward to accept Christ too!&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    Moriah and Kayleigh were very serious and well-spoken 14-year-old girls who told me they came from a shelter.&nbsp; They each shared some of their hard lives; living in various foster homes among people of different religions.&nbsp; They were both aware of Jesus, and very eager to receive him as Lord and Savior.&nbsp; The girls asked to, &ldquo;Please follow-up!&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>I counseled a 17-year-old who told me last night he that he wanted to get up and come forward, but could not.&nbsp; He said he thought about it all night.&nbsp; This morning he arranged for one of his friends to bring him here, he came forward this time to receive Jesus.</p>
  <p>Ezekiel, age 15, was brought by a friend.&nbsp; Ezekiel had no church background.&nbsp; He understood Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice for him and made a commitment to Christ tonight.</p>
  <p>I counseled a woman and child.&nbsp; The woman told me that she and her family had come to see a non-Christian movie and instead were moved to watch Tribulation Force.&nbsp; Today she has accepted Jesus with her 2 boys and husband.&nbsp; Praise the Lord.</p>
  <p>Victor, a 71-year-old Hispanic man came forward in tears after the movie &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Already a member of a church.&nbsp; I had the privilege of leading him as he committed his life to Christ for the first time.&nbsp; This was my first experience doing this, WOW!!</p>
