  <h3>13th Annual Merrimack Valley Film Festival</h3>
  <div align="center"><em>Testimonies from the 605 recorded decisions for Christ made at the 13th Merrimack Valley Christian Film Festival</em><br><hr></div>
  <p>1.&nbsp; A 12 year old girl who had a rare crippling disease in which many of her joints were locked attended on Tuesday evening. &nbsp;From what I understand she might not have too much longer to live.&nbsp; On earth that is, because after watching Sting: Moment of Truth, it was the &ldquo;day of her Salvation&rdquo; as she gave her life to Jesus Christ.&nbsp; After counseling was finished we brought her to meet Sting in person.&nbsp; He took time to share with her and encourage her.&nbsp; Then this big hulk of a man picked up this tiny crippled girl and carried her in his arms through the lobby to the exit.&nbsp; It was a very emotional moving experience for everyone as many tears were being shed.</p>
  <p>2.&nbsp; Sunday I had the great privilege of leading an elderly man to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. The man was 90 years old and other than having a Catholic background did not attend any church. The Holy Spirit was evident to the effect he realized he was a sinner in need of a Savior. I took him through the booklet and he put his trust in our precious Lord. He has a great desire to grow in the Lord even at his age, and I'm going to send him a large-print Bible.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>3.&nbsp; Richard was an eleven-year-old boy who came down front. He he had been involved in sin and wanted to get right with God again. I shared some verses and he bowed his head and prayed, confessing his sin and receiving God's forgiveness and cleansing. I prayed for him to walk close to Jesus and to read the Bible and pray everyday. I also encouraged him to ask Jesus for help whenever sin's temptation comes his way. Praise God for the sensitivity of this young boy. </p>
  <p>4.&nbsp; A man, son and daughter came forward and all three asked Jesus into their hearts. I counseled the boy.&nbsp; He couldn't understand how Jesus took his punishment, so I explained it to him.&nbsp; When he realized Jesus took his punishment, he smiled.&nbsp; When he realized Jesus would always be with him, he smiled. When he heard he would go to heaven when he died, he smiled.&nbsp; He has a new life in Christ. Praise God for bringing this family to Him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>5.&nbsp; Nick, a 10-year-old and his father, bought tickets for a secular movie. Someone told them there were free Christian movies, so instead of going into the movie they already paid for they went to see Sting: Moment of Truth.&nbsp; When the invitation was given, both father and son received Jesus as Lord and Savior!&nbsp; Thank you Lord!</p>
  <p>6.&nbsp; John, age 54, was sitting in the audience after the show was over. I went up and talked with him. I asked if he knew where he would go when he died, he said, &quot;I hope I will get into heaven.&quot; I shared that God wants him to know for sure. We went through the booklet John prayed to receive Christ as Savior and Lord. Praise God for another soul saved.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>7.&nbsp; Joey is a 12-year-old who wasn't right with God because of sin in his life.&nbsp; Joey confessed his sin and received God's forgiveness. He wants to please God. I shared with him that because the Holy Spirit lives in him, he will give Joey power to resist sin and the desire and power to do what is right. Praise God for his saving and keeping power.</p>
  <p>8.&nbsp; I counseled a woman after &quot;Sting&quot; who came forward to receive Christ. She pointed out that her husband and three sons, ages 8 to 15, all came forward together as a family to commit their lives to Jesus. </p>
  <p>9.&nbsp; Four young men who are gang-members were standing in the hallway, watching the counselors pray. They wanted to join us, but were afraid to ask. They asked two ushers to pray with them instead, and wanted to hold hands as they prayed like we were doing. Ten minutes later they were still hanging around and I went over to see if I could be of service. They shared that they are facing hard time in prison and they wanted God's help. I asked them if they were serious about wanting to change their lives and destinies. They said they were, and all four prayed to ask Jesus into their hearts. We told them God would do what was best for them. We prayed over them and saw that they were sincere. </p>
  <p>10.&nbsp; Tribulation Force ended, the invitation was given, a man came forward to rededicate his life to Christ. He was born again in 1994 had been a youth-group leader.&nbsp; As a military reservist, he got the call to go to Iraq, where he fell away from God. Tonight, knowing that he needed to come back, he completely surrendered his life to Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p>11.&nbsp; Rafael, 11-years-old, came with two or three others to see secular movies. They went into see the Messiah instead. Rafael accepted the Lord and I saw one of the others he was with also came forward to receive Jesus as Lord and Savior.</p>
  <p>12.&nbsp; The Dipre family doesn't go to church. The children attend Catholic school. On Saturday, the night before the film festival began, they went to the cinema to see a movie and didn&rsquo;t know about the Christian Film Festival until they received a flyer we were passing out. They came to see Sting: Moment of Truth.&nbsp; The mother, her three daughters, and her son all went forward to give their lives to Christ. The mother said that she would bring her husband and two older sons tomorrow. </p>
  <p>13.&nbsp; What a blessing! 15 kids from an after-school literacy program, which is Christian-based and open to the public, went forward. I counseled two 7-year-old girls who prayed with Tom to ask Jesus into their hearts. They understood the booklet and were pleased with having Jesus living in them. I was overwhelmed with joy to see so many receive Jesus. God was moving among these children. There is rejoicing in heaven over these souls, praise God for his mighty work!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>14.&nbsp; The Lord is amazing! After the kids prayed with Tom, I took 2 boys and a girl, back into the seats. The girl told me that one of the boys is deaf. His name is Omar. I was so excited to tell him I know sign language! I was able to go through the booklet with him, signing the whole thing. He was so excited to have me to sign to him. He could UNDERSTAND.&nbsp; I asked him, &quot;Did you invite Jesus into your heart?&quot; He gave me the &quot;yes&quot; sign. &quot;Then where is Jesus?&quot; He told me - &quot;In my heart!&quot; Praise God! What a blessing and a joy for me.&nbsp; The girl, Patricia, was so excited to see someone signing to him. She and the other boy, Jeremy, sign a little bit. All three were saved today!&nbsp; Valerie is an instruction for the deaf.&nbsp; With all of the counselors at the front of the theater it truly was God at work when somehow she got matched up with a deaf child.</p>
  <p>15.&nbsp; Today I counseled a Muslim! I have visited a Mosque in India, walked past many in Singapore, rode on busses and subways and walked the streets with Muslims. I realize Muslims are very difficult to talk with about eternal life and hell vs. heaven and God and Jesus.&nbsp; I was a blessing to see a Muslim receive Jesus as Lord &amp; Savior. </p>
  <p>16.&nbsp; I counseled a 64-year-old Polish Catholic woman, Krystyna. It was after Tribulation Force.&nbsp; We had a lengthy discussion about faith vs. works, I shared with her how to receive Christ and she&nbsp; prayed the prayer of salvation. We talked all the way through until the next movie was starting. It was Luther and I told her she had to see this movie. She stayed for it.&nbsp; Luther talks about the false teachings of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; This woman spent her whole life in the Catholic Church and felt compelled to follow all the rules the church set forth. &nbsp;Now she has been set free!&nbsp; </p>
  <p>17.&nbsp; I have to say that when our church announced Tom Saab coming to speak and asking people to participate I was not going to do it.&nbsp; But after listening to him share the testimonies etc.&nbsp; God really moved my heart so I went as a counselor.&nbsp; It was a privilege and I hope to do it again next year.&nbsp; I only had the opportunity to counsel three people &ndash; the highlight was a 13 year old boy who attended a Catholic church like once a month with his father I think he came with a friend who also got saved.&nbsp; He was very excited&nbsp; and grateful.&nbsp; God bless you all in your ministry!</p>
  <p>18.&nbsp; I counseled at the festival, I was very scared and almost chickened out.&nbsp; But the most wonderful thing happened in my own family during this most wonderful week.&nbsp; My own daughter came to Christ on Easter Sunday, not at the film festival, but in Hawaii where she is attending school.&nbsp; I know that was a gift to me from God and the timing was amazing!&nbsp; I helped lead 6 people to Christ and it was the most wonderful week of my life!&nbsp; I am so thankful and joy filled that I participated in this amazing incredible Film Festival.&nbsp; God is so faithful, even when we are not!&nbsp; I will continue to pray for those new young Christians!&nbsp; Thank you for helping me continue to understand it is not about me its all about Jesus!&nbsp; </p>
  <p>19.&nbsp; Derrick, our videographer, shared the testimony of his mother- in- law.&nbsp; A catholic woman, who rejected the gospel message and said she felt she was &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; was convinced to go to the film festival on Monday night.&nbsp; She went to see STING &ldquo;Moment of Truth&rdquo;; heard the closing message but was not ready to commit her life to Christ.&nbsp; A young female counselor went up into the theater after the invitation to talk to people still sitting in their seats.&nbsp; She met this woman and asked if she could pray with her.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit worked in her heart that night.&nbsp; The next day Derrick; knowing she had been at the theater the night before, went and visited her Tuesday morning.&nbsp; There Derrick shared again what she had heard the night before in the theater and, as Derrick told us, she got on her knees, prayed and invited Jesus into her heart as Lord and Savior.</p>
  <p>20.&nbsp; On Saturday March 26 a mother, son and daughter all came forward together and committed their lives to Jesus Christ.&nbsp; All 3 were Unitarian Universalist who now had heard the truth about Jesus and the free gift of Eternal Life that only he could provide.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
