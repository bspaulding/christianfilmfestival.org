      13th Annual Merrimack Valley Christian Film Festival

    <p class="testimony_description">
      A 12 year old girl who had a rare crippling disease in which many of her joints were locked attended on Tuesday evening.  From what I understand she might not have too much longer to live.  On earth that is, because after watching Sting: Moment of Truth, it was the “day of her Salvation” as she gave her life to Jesus Christ.  After counseling was finished we brought her to meet Sting in person.  He took time to share with her and encourage her.  Then this big hulk of a man picked up this tiny crippled girl and carried her in his arms through the lobby to the exit.  It was a very emotional moving experience for everyone as many tears were being shed.<br/>

    <p class="testimony_description">
      Throughout the week a number of people who were members of the Boston Church of Christ cult came forward to receive Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior.&nbsp; All were referred to Evangelical / Bible believing churches for follow-up.<br/><br/>
      Three sisters ages 12, 14, &amp; 15 who moved to So. Lawrence a few months ago from Philadelphia were eating at Taco Bell on Rt. 114.&nbsp; A woman was walking around giving out free tickets to the Christian Film Festival.&nbsp; She gave tickets to the 3 girls.&nbsp; They came to the film festival and when the invitation was given all three responded together.&nbsp; They came forward and received Jesus as their Lord and Savior.&nbsp; They had no church affiliation and never clearly understood who Jesus was until today!&nbsp; They came back the next day and went forward for special prayer.&nbsp; The day before they didn&rsquo;t really know what prayer was.

      Guilmero made a first time commitment to Christ tonight. He came to the festival because <strong>someone handed him a free ticket as he was driving his car.</strong>&nbsp; -George Kessler Jr.<br/><br/>
      Christina came forward to ask Jesus into her heart. She was carrying a 5 month old baby in her arms. She identified with the need and desire to talk to God and didn&rsquo;t know where to begin. <strong>She came to the film festival because a free ticket was put in her sisters trick or treat bag.</strong>&nbsp; -Gretchen Simas

    <p class="testimony_description">
      We have been able to participate in the Christian film festival for the 3rd time now. Each year we have had at least one teen from our youth group come and accept Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord &ndash; this year was no exception. We had 2 teenage boys in high school, 1 teen girl, and a youth worker&rsquo;s 8-year old son all come to Christ tonight. Praise the Lord! We have been praying for this for months, and God has answered beyond our hopes in a &ldquo;4&rdquo; for one night.
