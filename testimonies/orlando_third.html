  <h3>3rd Annual Greater Orlando Film Festival</h3>
	<p>We have been able to participate in the Christian film festival for the 3rd time now. Each year we have had at least one teen from our youth group come and accept Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord &ndash; this year was no exception. We had 2 teenage boys in high school, 1 teen girl, and a youth worker&rsquo;s 8-year old son all come to Christ tonight. Praise the Lord! We have been praying for this for months, and God has answered beyond our hopes in a &ldquo;4&rdquo; for one night.</p>
  <p>A mother has been praying for her whole family and today her son got saved. She believes that the Lord will save her daughter as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Greta will be 34 years old on 5/28/03. She was with her dad walking by the theater and saw the film poster. She asked if they could come in; they did; When the Jesus film was over, Greta told her father she wanted to give her heart to the Lord. Glory Hallelujah!</p>
  <p>Today an 11-year old boy named Van gave his heart to Jesus Christ after watching &ldquo;Escape from Hell.&rdquo; Van came down to the altar with tears in his eyes as he shared with me that he would share Jesus Christ with his dad and friends. What an awesome Mother&rsquo;s Day gift, as his mom wept continuously.</p>
  <p>Counselor Carlos Alvarez&rsquo;s two children gave their lives to Christ. He is so happy. He&rsquo;s bringing his family in a little at a time.</p>
  <p>On Thursday afternoon, a 13-year-old boy received Christ. He said that 2 years ago his grandmother, grandfather (who the boy lived with) and he were here (at the Christian Film Festival) and his grandfather got sick. As I was led by the Lord to go congratulate his grandmother, I could easily se tears held back in her eyes. She then told me the story of how 2 years ago, to the day, the 3 of them came to this exact theater to se a movie at the Christian Film Festival. She said that her husband had a massive stroke right over there in the second seat and had to be rushed to the hospital. She said that Tom&rsquo;s staff was wonderful! They stopped the movie and assisted the ambulance in getting her husband to the hospital. She said even though he didn&rsquo;t feel well prior to the movie, he insisted they stay for the movie. She also said that if they had been at home (quite a distance away), he would never have gotten to the hospital in time. He was revived and able to see his family and relatives before passing on to the Lord 2 weeks later.</p>
  <p>A 12-year old girl and her friend came down after the counseling started. The friend was bringing the girl to her youth group. She was crying as she received Jesus as her Savior. The girl&rsquo;s family stopped going to church when they moved here from New York. The 2 girls are very close and are now sisters in Christ.</p>
  <p>Mariah&rsquo;s mom said that Mariah&rsquo;s decision was an answer to prayer. She had prayed that Mariah would receive Christ into her heart before the second grade school year ended.</p>
  <p>Fourteen-year old wanted to kill herself &ndash; she felt worthless.&nbsp; She accepted Jesus Christ of Nazareth as Lord and Savior after seeing the movie &ldquo;Escape from Hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had the humble privilege of leading a man named Jay in the prayer of salvation today.&nbsp; He just happened to come to the theater to watch a secular movie.&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the advertisement, decided to come in and God did the rest.&nbsp; He said it was a miracle.</p>
  <p>This had to be one of the most touching and powerful salvations I have seen yet.&nbsp; A man came forward at the end of &ldquo;Escape from Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told me he had some real family problems and the he was ready to receive Christ as his Savior!&nbsp; We went through the commitment folder together, and about that time Tom asked us to move to the prayer room.&nbsp; As we were walking up the steps, he was greeted by friends and family 9 hugs and crying 0.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s Spirit was just so mighty that it was enough to just bring you to tears.&nbsp; All those people had prayed for him for a long time.&nbsp; This is what the power of prayer results in!&nbsp; Keep on praying!&nbsp; What an honor.&nbsp; Thank you Jesus.</p>
  <p>A young man came forward, and I went to counsel him.&nbsp; He cried as he told me he needed Christ, as he believed he has been serving the devil for the last 5 years, making money in very bad ways.&nbsp; I told him that today his slate is clean and even though he was not sinless that Jesus will help him sin less every day.&nbsp; He simile and went on to tell me that with Jesus he hopes to become a better person.&nbsp; He felt brand new, Amen!&nbsp; He is 36 years old and said he will change his life the Christ&rsquo;s love, mercy and grace.</p>
